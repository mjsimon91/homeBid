# Home Bid

## Descritption
Home Bid is an application built on Node.js and Express.js using handlebars as a templating tool. 

At homebid, users can either sell or bid on homes. Home sellers receive notifications on bids and chooses best bid based on price and terms. Home bid is geared towards anyone from home investors wanting to turn houses or that couple looking to settle down in their first home.

## Key Features
Homes listed start at an intial bid of $1.00 allowing the market to be judged soley on the bidders interested in the homes. Cards (or tiles) are interactive with a modal feature to browse the finer details of the home. View and Bid counts are tallied, and instantly updated to the database for the next bidder to see. 

Each member has a profile where they can message directly with interested bidders to further negotiate. A Seller can also manage their listed homes and keep track of their active bids.
